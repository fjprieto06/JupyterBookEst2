    "In Lesson 2 we introduced the concept of hypothesis testing, with the aim of comparing the values of population parameters of interest to some prespecified reference values. In many practical situations we would prefer to compare the values of population parameters to the corresponding ones from other populations, based on information from two samples of both populations, instead of comparing them to given reference values.\n",

    "We will introduce the main considerations we should take into account when extending the hypothesis testing procedure of Lesson 2 to the comparison of two populations. Overall, the procedure will remain unchanged except for some details. These details will be mostly related to  two main aspects we will take into account for the adaptation of the procedure: the relationship between the samples, and the selection of test statistics to conduct the corresponding tests.\n"

    "We present the main steps to be completed to conduct this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to formulate the null and alternative hypotheses for this problem. These hypotheses will be based on the comparison of the mean grades for the two groups. Some relevant questions on the formulation of these hypotheses would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Should the null hypothesis be written as $H_0 : \\mu_A \\leq \\mu_B$? \n",
    "   \n",
    "     If we proceed with this null hypothesis, we will only be able to answer questions such as \"Is the mean of A smaller than the mean of B?\", which has a trivial answer, or \"Is the mean of A significantly larger than the mean of B?\", which is clearly not true given the data.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Should we use a two-sided test?\n",
    "   \n",
    "     This is a more informative option, but it would have the consequence that, for the values of interest on the left tail of the distribution, the rejection region will be smaller than that for a one-sided test.\n",
    "     \n",
    "<span style=\"color:brown;\">Discuss why the values on the left tail are more relevant, why the critical value for the left tail will be smaller, compared to that for a two-sided test, what consequences this could have on your conclusion for the test, and wether rejecting less might be a desirable outcome.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of these comments, the null and alternative hypotheses for this test will be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rl}\n",
    "H_0 : & \\mu_A \\geq \\mu_B \\\\\n",
    "H_1 : & \\mu_A < \\mu_B\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We need to assume that the samples are independent. Also, we must decide if we would consider our samples to be sufficiently large or if the data follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that we have large samples, that is, that the CLT provides a reasonable approximation to the distribution of the test statistic. The alternative choice of assuming normality is in general far more restrictive, providing worse approximations, unless we are certain that our data presents a very good fit for this distribution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Our test statistic will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T = \\frac{\\bar x_A - \\bar x_B - (\\mu_A - \\mu_B)}{\\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \\frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}} \\sim_{\\scriptsize \\text{approx.}} N(0,1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value for this statistic corresponding to our data, under the null hypothesis $\\mu_A = \\mu_B$, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "t_0 & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{6.46 - 6.88}{\\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\frac{1.79^2}{42} + \\frac{1.66^2}{35}}} = -1.0679\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To conduct the test we may select a significance value. But as our goal is to understand if the evidence would suggest that there might be a problem with the homogeneity of the tests in different groups, it is much more informative to compute the p-value for this test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is obtained from the value of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{p-value} = \\Pr (Z < t_0 ) = \\Pr(Z < -1.0679 ) = 0.143\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Our conclusion for this test would be that the evidence in our samples is not sufficient to reject $H_0$ for any significance level of 14% or less. Based on this information we must decide if this significance level is reasonable for us to conclude that there is a lack of homogeneity in the tests, or if the evidence is not sufficient to reach this conclusion. Note that selecting a significance level also has implications on the probability of a type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green;\">Some additional questions for this exercise:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:green;\">What would be the p-value of this test if the test were two-sided? How would that value influence your conclusion?</span>\n",
